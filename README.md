# Industrial use of computer vision to help automate a small part of the manufacturing process.

  This project focused on using advanced machine learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automate a portion of the manufacturing process of transformers in the GE factory in Gebze. By implementing computer vision and digital cameras, the project aimed to develop a vision algorithm to count man-hours on the factory floor and to track the progress of transformer units using image matching algorithms. This project showcases expertise in industrial automation, computer vision, and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The use of state-of-the-art algorithms and techniques highlights your proficiency in quantitative research and practical application.
